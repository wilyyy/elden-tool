# Elden Tool

A vanilla typescript application created by myself, William Laurel for learning. The premise of this project is to act as a small wikipedia for different facets for the role playing game Elden Ring. I also plan to develop small features that will help make life easier for Elden Ring players. This project uses [public Elden Ring API from Deliton.](https://docs.eldenring.fanapis.com/)

**Key tools used**
  - Typescript
  - Tailwind
  - Webpack

### Motivation
Wanting to step away from my comfort zone of developing with Next.js and using powerful React libraries like axios to solve my problems, I wanted a new challenge to build a vanilla typescript node application. Having been over a year since I last made a vanilla javascript project, I want to brush up on and perhaps even level up my vanilla javascript skills using modern practices and further accustom myself to efficient use of typescript. Although this may seem like a masochistic endeavour, I hope to learn more about the ins and outs of software design from a web point of view without being spoiled by the powerful tools a Javascript framework brings to the table.

**Below are some things I've learned so far**
  - Building a node app from scratch and customizing it for typescript and tailwind, as well as setting up webpack to bundle my application
  - Learning how to configure my custom node application manually for deployment to vercel
  - Modern 2022 vanilla javascript practices
  - Thinking more logically to create clean code solutions without assisstance from react features such as their custom hooks and other people's react libraries
